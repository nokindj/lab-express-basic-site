            <h5 class="para-about">Jamie Trevor Oliver MBE (born 27 May 1975) is a British chef and restaurateur. He is known for his approachable cuisine, which has led him to front numerous television shows and open many restaurants.</h5>
            <p class="para-about">Born and raised in Clavering, Essex, he was educated in London before joining Antonio Carluccio's Neal Street restaurant as a pastry chef. While serving as a sous-chef at the River Caf√©, he was noticed by Patricia Llewellyn of Optomen;[1] and in 1999 the BBC aired his television show The Naked Chef. This was followed by a first cook book, which became a No. 1 UK bestseller. His television work included a documentary, Jamie's Kitchen, which gained him an invitation from Prime Minister Tony Blair to visit 10 Downing Street.
                In 2005, he opened a campaign, Feed Me Better, to introduce schoolchildren to healthier foods, which was later backed by the government. He was the owner of a restaurant chain, Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group, which opened its first restaurant, Jamie's Italian, in Oxford in 2008. The chain went into administration in May 2019.[2]</p>
                <p class="para-about">His TED Talk won him the 2010 TED Prize. In June 2003, Oliver was awarded a Member of the Order of the British Empire.</p>
